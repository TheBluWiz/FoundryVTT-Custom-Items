## Balance Adjustments

- ~~Fortitude Save Adjustments~~

   - ~~Critical Success - Hit Point Maximum Reduced by 1~~
   - ~~Success - Hit point Maxium and Current HP reduced by 1~~
   - ~~Failure - Hit point maximum and current hit points reduced by 1 per level~~
   - ~~Critical Failure - Same as failure but doube the hit point reduction~~

- ~~Player can decrease the permanent HP drain by 1 point per full day of rest as a downtime activity in a safe and comfortable location.~~

These adjustments will prevent "unlimited" spell heightening, and potentnially encourage players to use the item even though it is cursed.

## Code Base
- Create README.md explaining how to use repo (provide feedback, use the code, provide troubleshooting steps, and a QA section).
- Make this an isntallible module so it can be imported to Foundry VTT rather than be manually added to a campaign.
