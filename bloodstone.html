<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day<br><strong>Requirements</strong> You are a prepared or spontaneous spellcaster.<br><strong>Effect</strong> When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can activate the Blood Stone to increase that spell’s level by 1 (to a maximum of 10th level). This functions like heightening a spell, improving its effects accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Curse — Life-Draining Stone</strong><br>Whenever you activate the Blood Stone, you must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> No ill effect.</li>
    <li><strong>Success</strong> You lose 1 Hit Point permanently (maximum Hit Points are reduced).</li>
    <li><strong>Failure</strong> You lose a number of permanent Hit Points equal to your level.</li>
    <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You lose twice your level in permanent Hit Points.</li>
</ul>
<p>These lost Hit Points reduce your maximum Hit Points until restored. Only a year of uninterrupted rest or powerful restorative magic (such as <em>wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>regenerate</em> of a level equal to or higher than the heightened spell you cast) can restore them. You are unaware of this reduction unless someone succeeds at a DC 28 Occultism or Medicine check to identify the malady.</p>

<p><strong>Demonic Awakening</strong><br>The Blood Stone tracks the total amount of life-force it consumes. Once it has drained 100 Hit Points, it cracks open, releasing a blood demon (use an appropriate demon stat block, such as a kalavakus or custom demon) that is hostile to all creatures. After summoning the demon, the Blood Stone crumbles into worthless dust.</p>
