<p><strong>Frequency</strong> At will<br><strong>Requirements</strong> You are a prepared or spontaneous spellcaster.<br><strong>Effect</strong> When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can activate the Blood Stone to increase that spell’s level by 1 (to a maximum of 10th level). This functions like heightening a spell, improving its effects accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Curse — Life-Draining Stone</strong><br>Whenever you activate the Blood Stone, you must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Critical Success</strong> You permanently lose 1 Hit Point (your maximum Hit Points are reduced by 1).</li>
    <li><strong>Success</strong> You permanently lose 1 Hit Point and take 1 damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure</strong> You permanently lose Hit Points equal to your level and take an equal amount of damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You permanently lose Hit Points equal to twice your level and take an equal amount of damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>These lost Hit Points reduce your maximum Hit Points until restored. Each day of Long-Term Rest in a safe location restores 1 point to your maximum Hit Points. Powerful restorative magic—such as <em>wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>regenerate</em> cast at a spell level equal to or higher than the heightened level of the effect that caused the reduction—can restore all lost maximum Hit Points instantly. You are unaware of this reduction unless someone succeeds at a DC 28 Medicine or Occultism check to identify the condition.</p>

<p><strong>Demonic Awakening</strong><br>The Blood Stone tracks the total amount of life-force it consumes. Once it has drained 100 Hit Points, it cracks open, releasing a blood demon (use an appropriate demon stat block, such as a kalavakus or custom demon) that is hostile to all creatures. After summoning the demon, the Blood Stone crumbles into worthless dust.</p>
